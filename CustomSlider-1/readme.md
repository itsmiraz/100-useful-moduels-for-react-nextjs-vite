# Slider Component Documentation
The Slider component is a React component built with Next.js and Vite. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion for animations.

## Usage
To use the Slider component, follow the steps below:

1. Install the required dependencies:

``` bash
npm install react react-dom next framer-motion
npm install -D vite tailwindcss autoprefixer postcss
```

2. Create a new file, e.g., Slider.js, and paste the code for the Slider component.

3. Import the necessary dependencies at the top of your file:

``` bash
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
import Image from 'next/image';
``` 
4.Use the Slider component in your application:

``` bash
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Slider />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
``` 

## Slider Props
The Slider component does not accept any props.

## Example
Here's an example of how you can use the Slider component:

``` bash
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
import Image from 'next/image';

const Data = [
  // Data objects for slider items
  // ...
];

const Slider = () => {
  const [services, setServices] = useState(1);

  const SmallCard = ({ data }) => {
    // SmallCard component code
    // ...
  };

  return (
    <div className="mx-auto w-full md:w-[850px]">
      {/* Slider navigation buttons */}
      {/* ... */}

      {/* Show slider content based on selected service */}
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Slider;

```

## Customization
You can customize the Slider component by modifying the styles, content, and data. Here are some areas you can customize:

1. Styling: The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. You can modify the classes to change the appearance of the slider.

2. Content: The Data array contains the data for each slider item. You can update the img and title properties to display your desired content.

3. Number of Services: The component currently supports four services. You can add or remove services by updating the services state and modifying the corresponding JSX sections in the component.

4. Animations: The component uses Framer Motion for animations. You can modify the animation properties and transitions to customize the slider's behavior.

Note: Make sure to import and install the necessary packages for customization, such as tailwindcss, autoprefixer, postcss, and framer-motion.

That's it! You now have a Slider component that you can integrate into your React/Next.js/Vite application. Feel free to customize it further to fit your specific requirements.
